 abstract = {Demographic models that use marked animals to estimate survival rates and population size assume no tag loss occurs, otherwise estimates are biased. Most studies of tag loss have assumed loss of 1 tag was independent of loss of the other, as did a prior study of ear tag loss in Pennsylvania black bears (Ursus americanus). We used permanently marked (tattooed) black bears to model ear tag loss rates so we could identify bears recovered missing both ear tags, and thus test the independence assumption. We found ear tag loss in male bears increased with time between tagging and recovery. Also, for males, the probability of losing a second ear tag was greater if it had already lost an ear tag. For a tagging-recovery interval of 0.5-<1 year, we estimated 3% of males lost both ear tags (95% CI = 2-4%); however, for an interval of 4.5-<5.5 years, we estimated 56% lost both ear tags (95% CI = 42-75%). We selected the same type of model for females, but ear tag loss rates were much lower. We estimated 2% of females lost both ear tags for tagging-recovery intervals of 0.5-<1 year (95% CI = 1-4%), and 5% of females lost both ear tags for intervals of 4-<5 years (95% CI = 1-18%). Comparison of survival estimates with and without a correction for ear tag loss suggests uncorrected annual survival estimates may be biased -6% for males and -1% for females. Black bears are a long-lived species with high loss rates of ear tags for males. Estimates of survival rates or population size that use mark-recapture type models should either incorporate ear tag loss in the model, especially for males, or use data from short time intervals (≤1 yr) to minimize bias from ear tag loss. In addition to ear tagging to identify individuals for mark-recapture studies, we recommend researchers tattoo bears on both inner sides of the upper lip.},

Mean retention of VIA and elastomer tags after 90 d was 32 $\pm$ 20% and 77 $\pm$ 19%, respectively. After 90 d the fish mean mortality from VIA tags (20 $\pm$ 5%) was significantly higher than from elastomer tags (7 $\pm$ 2%) and untagged control groups (11 $\pm$ 2%). Elastomer tags appear most suitable for marking batches of fish of various size, while VIA tags appear suitable for identification of larger individuals of species such as many gobies that have adequate transparent tissue for tag recognition. },

 abstract = {Rates of tag loss were estimated in a long-term tagging study of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) to assess the potential for bias in estimates of survival rates. Dalton Jumbo Rototags® were applied to each hind flipper of 5,743 recently weaned elephant seal pups on Marion Island from 1983 to 1993. We adapted and developed a method based on the resighting times of seals retaining 1 or 2 tags to estimate tag loss and test for effects of age and sex of the seals. Tag loss by young seals was low, but there was a strong increase in tag loss with seal age, especially for males. Annual single tag loss at age 14 was 10% for males and 5.6% for females. Although these are relatively modest rates of tag loss, substantial fractions of seals (35% of males and 17% of females) would lose both tags by age 15, requiring corrections to avoid bias in demographic studies based on these tagging data. The method we used to estimate tag loss has significant advantages over a ratio estimator that has been used for most previous studies of tag loss in pinnipeds.},
