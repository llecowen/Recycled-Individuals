\section{Web Appendix A: The Jolly-Seber Tag Loss
Model}\label{web-appendix-a-the-jolly-seber-tag-loss-model}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions}

Assumptions of the JSTL model with constant survival, capture, and tag
retention probabilities and time-varying entry probabilities are as
follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The effect of recycled individuals is negligible
\item
  All individuals (marked and unmarked) are equally catchable, and that
  capture probabilities for all individuals are the same for all
  individuals at all sample time
\item
  All individuals (marked and unmarked) have equal survival
  probabilities between all sample times
\item
  All individuals have equal entry (birth or immigration) probabilities,
  but entry probabilities can vary between sample times
\item
  All marked individuals have equal tag retention probabilities between
  all sample times
\item
  For double-tagged individuals, tag loss is independent between tags
\item
  There is independence across all individuals
\item
  The sampling period is relatively short compared to the interval
  between sampling times
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Notation}\label{notation}

\subsubsection{Likelihood and Estimation}\label{likelihood-and-estimation}

The likelihood of the JSTL model can be divided into three parts: the
probability of observing \(n_{\text{obs}}\), the number of tag
histories, given the super-population size (\(L_1^A\)), the probability
of observing recaptures given the number of tag histories (\(L_1^B\)),
and the probability of observing the number of individuals lost on
capture (\(L_3\)).

The probability of observing \(n_\text{obs}\) capture histories is given
by a binomial distribution conditional on the super-population size. \[
L_1^A=[n_{\text{obs}}|N] \sim \text{Binomial} (N, 1-P_0) \text{, where}
\] \[
P_0\text{ is the probability of never being seen, given by } P_0=\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} b_j (1-p) \chi_{(0,j+1,0)}. 
\]

The probability of observing each unique tag history \(\omega_i\) is
modeled by a multinomial conditional upon being observed at least once.
\[
L_1^B=[n_{\omega_i}|n_{obs}] \sim \text{Multinomial} (n_{obs}, \pi_{\omega_i}) \text{, where} 
\] \[
\pi_{\omega_i}= P_{\omega_i}/(1-P_0) \text{ and}
\] \[
P(\omega_i)=\psi_{f_i} T_d \left\{ \prod_{j=f_i}^{l_i} p^{w*_{ij}} (1-p)^{(1-w*_{ij})} \right\} \left\{ \phi^{l_i-1-f_i} \right\} \times \prod_{d=1}^{2} \left\{ \left( \lambda^{l_{id}-1-f_i} \right) \left(1- \lambda^{q_{id}-1-l_{id}} \right)^{I(l_{id} \neq l_i)} \right\} \times \chi_{f_i, l_i, nt_{l_i}}
\]

The third component \(L_3\) models the number of losses on capture as a
binomial. In this study we assume there is no possibility of loss on
capture, this third component of the likelihood simplifies to 1. 


The complete likelihood for the Jolly-Seber tag loss model assuming no
possibility of loss of capture and assuming homogeneous survival,
capture, and tag retention probabilities is given below.

\[
L=\binom{N}{n_\text{obs}} \left\{ \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} b_j(1-p)\chi_{(0,j+1,0)} \right\} ^{(N-n_\text{obs})} \times \left\{ 1- \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} b_j(1-p)\chi_{(0,j+1,0)} \right\} ^{n_\text{obs}} \times
\] \[
\binom{n_\text{obs}}{n_{\omega_1},n_{\omega_2},...,n_{\omega_m}} \prod_{i=1}^{m} \Bigg[ \psi_{f_i} T_d \left\{ \prod_{j=f_i}^{l_i} p^{w*_{ij}} (1-p)^{(1-w*_{ij})} \right\} \left\{ \prod_{j=f_i}^{l_i-1} \phi \right\} \times 
\] \[
\prod_{d=1}^{2} \left\{ \left( \prod_{j=f_i}^{l_{id}-1} \lambda \right) \left(1-\prod_{j=l_{id}}^{q_{id}-1} \lambda \right)^{I(l_{id} \neq l_i)} \right\} \times \chi_{f_i, l_i, nt_{l_i}} \Bigg]^{n_{\omega_i}} \times 
\] \[
\left\{ 1- \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} b_j(1-p)\chi_{(0,j+1,0)} \right\} ^{-n_\text{obs}}
\]

\textsc{Web Figure 42:} Mean abundance estimates (\(N_j\)'s) for each
sample time (\(k=7\)) between analysis with and without recycled
individuals with population size \(N=1000\) with \(T_2=1\) with 5 time
periods for high tag retention (\(\lambda=0.9\)), varying survival
probabilities (\(\phi=0.2,0.5,0.9\)) and varying capture probabilities
(\(p=0.2,0.5,0.9\)).
