\noindent Dear Editor,

\bigskip

I would like to submit revisions to the manuscript previously entitled ``The effect of recycled individuals in the Jolly-Seber model with tag loss".  I have responded to Reviewer comments in point by point form below. 

\bigskip

\noindent {\bf Associate Editor Comments}
We agree with the Associate Editor's suggestions for title changes and distribution of code and have addressed these comments below.

\noindent {\bf Reviewer 1 Comments}
\begin{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent {\bf Reviewer 2 Comments}
\begin{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent {\bf Reviewer 3 Comments}
\begin{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  {\it Line 53, ``caecilian" should be plural.}

Done.

\item  {\it Line 146: I should have spotted this before - the super population parameter N is no more a modelling concept that any other parameter in the model - there really IS a superpopulation N.  I accept that it might not be of much demographic interest.  I would delete ``a modelling concept".}

Deleted ``a modelling concept".


\item  {\it Line 172 - I still don't see why phat = 1 is unreliable.  It is the MLE. Is it less reliable than 0.99?  If you want to bring in a priori wighting of different values of p then you should fit a Bayesian model.  I accept that at the boundary the regularity conditions fail but this doesn't make the estimate any more unreliable than any other value.}

We have changed this sentence to read:

``When the estimation of $p$ was on a boundary, $N_j$ was estimated at infinity ($\hat{p}=0$) or $\sum_i r_{ij}$  ($\hat{p}=1$)."


\end{enumerate}


\noindent Sincerely,

\bigskip
